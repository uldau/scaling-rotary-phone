Task 1

What is the medically relevant insight from the article? Mobile element
variants (MEVs) significantly contribute to diversification of the human
genome, gene regulation and disease risk. Specific MEVs such as Alu,
LINE-1 (L1) and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) show population-specific
distributions and take part in regulating tissue-specific gene
expression. MEVs can be more strongly associated with gene expression
changes than single-nucleotide variants, which suggests that it is
possible for them to drive phenotypic traits, including disease
susceptibilities. One L1 insertion in this dtudy was linked to an
increased risk for keloid formation and fasciitis

Which genomics technology/ technologies were used? Short-read
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) mobile element genotype analysis
environment (MEGAnE) (bioinformatic tool enabling discovery and
genotyping of ME insertions and absences)

Three questions/ hypothesis to extend the analysis presented in the
paper How do MEVs impact polygenic disease risks in different
populations? What roles do MEVs play in epigenetic regulation snd
chromativ state remodeling? Can MEVs be utilized as biomarkers for
predicitng susceptibility to specific cimplex traits or diseases?

Task 4

Load the CO2 dataset into R and display the content of it with the
help() function

```{r}
# Loading the CO2 dataset
data(CO2)
# Accessing description of the CO2 dataset using the help function
help(CO2)
```

The dataset contains data about CO2 uptake (μmol/m\^2 sec) of 6
different plants in two different temperature conditions (nonchilled and
chilled) and two different geological locations (Quebec and Canada). It
also contains information about the ambient CO2 concentration in mL/L.

Creating subsets of the data and calculating the average and median

```{r}
# Creating subsets of the dataset
Quebec <- subset(CO2, CO2$Type=="Quebec")
Mississippi <- subset(CO2, CO2$Type=="Mississippi")

# Calculating the average and median of the subdatasets
average_Quebec <- mean(Quebec$uptake)
average_Quebec

average_Mississippi <- mean(Mississippi$uptake)
average_Mississippi

median_Quebec <- median(Quebec$uptake)
median_Quebec

median_Mississippi <- median(Mississippi$uptake)
median_Mississippi
```

The average CO2 uptake in Quebec is 33.543μmol/m\^2 sec and the mean
37.15μmol/m\^2 sec. The average Co2 uptake in Mississippi is
20.883μmol/m\^2 sec and the mean 19.3μmol/m\^2 sec. '

Load and display "airway" data from bioconductor and counting the
expressed genes per sample as well as how many genes were not expressed
in general

```{r}
# Load and display airway data from Bioconductor
library(airway)
library(dbplyr)  # used for data manipulation
library(SummarizedExperiment) # useful when handling complex datasets in a more organized way

data("airway")
airway_se <- airway  # stored as a SummarizedExperiment object

# Counting the number of expressed genes, based on the assumption it's genes with a count greater than 0
# Extracting the counts matrix
counts_matrix <- assay(airway_se)

# Counting the number of genes that are expressed (count > 0) for each sample
expressed_genes_per_sample <- apply(counts_matrix, 2, function(x) sum(x > 0))  # The function apply (...,2,...) applies to each column of the count matrix, sum (x < 0) counts how many genes in one column (one sample) have an expression above 0
expressed_genes_per_sample

# Counting the number of genes that are not expressed (count == 0)
genes_not_expressed <- sum(rowSums(counts_matrix) == 0) # Counts how many genes are not expressed in any of the samples (not column (sample) specific) 
genes_not_expressed

```

Expressed genes per sample: SRR1039508 SRR1039509 SRR1039512 SRR1039513
SRR1039516 SRR1039517 SRR1039520 SRR1039521 24633 24527 25699 23124
25508 25998 24662 23991

Number of genes that are not expressed: 30208

Task 5

Function to calculate the ratio of the mean and the median of a dataset.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the ratio of the mean and the median
mean_median_ratio <- function(x) {
  # Checking that input is numeric
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input vector must be numeric.")
  }
  
  # Calculating the mean value
  mean_value <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Calculating the median
  median_value <- median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Calculating the ratio of the mean to the median
  ratio <- mean_value/median_value
  
  # Return the ratio
  return(ratio)
}
```

Function to calculate the mean excluding the highest and the lowest
value

```{r}
# Function to ignore lowest and highest value and calculates the mean
mean_without_extremes <- function(x) {
  # Checking that input is numeric
  if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input vector must be numeric.")
  }
  
  # Input needs to have more than 2 values, otherwise it would return empty
  if (length(x) <= 2) {
    stop("Input vector must contain more than two elements.")
  }
  
  # Removing smallest and highest values
  x_filtered <- x[x != min(x) & x != max(x)]
  
  # Calculating the mean of the remaining values
  mean_value <- mean(x_filtered, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Return the mean
  retun(mean_value)
}
```

If the highest or lowest value is present more then once in a dataset
this is a function which will only take out the value once

```{r}
# Alternative function if highest or lowest values occurs more then once. This will only remove the value once (the function above will remove all occurences of the minimum and maximum values)
mean_without_extremes_single <- function(x) {
  # Checking that input is numeric
  if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input vector must be numeric.")
  }
  
  # Input needs to have more than 2 values, otherwise it would return empty
  if (length(x) <= 2) {
    stop("Input vector must contain more than two elements.")
  }
  
  # Remove only one instance of the smallest and highest value
  x_filtered_single <- x[-which.min(x)]
  x_filtered_single <- x_filtered_single[-which.max(x_filtered_single)]
  
  # Calculating the mean of the remaining values
  mean_value_single <- mean(x_filtered_single, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Return the mean
  return(mean_value_single)
}
```

Piping chains commands/functions, passes output as input, reducing
intermediate variables. It improves readability and organizes code
linearly. However, for complex transformations or multiple
inputs/outputs, avoiding pipes can make code easier to follow.

The apply family (apply, lapply, sapply, tapply, etc) simplifies
repetitive tasks by applying functions to elements of data structures
like lists, matrices, or vectors. It reduces code complexity and avoids
loops, making operations faster and code easier to read. Useful for data
manipulation.

Save output as png, pdf and svg

```{r}
library(svglite)

# Save in PNG format
ggsave("height_comparison.png", plot = last_plot(), width = 7, height = 5)

# Save in PDF format
ggsave("height_comparison.pdf", plot = last_plot(), width = 7, height = 5)

# Save in SVG format
ggsave("height_comparison.svg", plot = last_plot(), width = 7, height = 5)
```

Figures that are used on the web or have many colors are best saved in a
png format. Pdf formats are best used for high-quality prints, vector
based graphics and are scalable. Figures/ graphics that will be embedded
in web pages and should be scalable are best saved in an svg format
(it's a vector based format).

Microarray dataset

```{r}
# Load the data
microarray_data <- read.delim("microarray_data.tab", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Check the size (rows and columns)
dim(microarray_data)  # This returns the number of rows and columns
```

The dataset has 553 rows and 1000 columns.

Missing values per gene (with vizualisation)

```{r}
# Count missing values per gene
missing_counts <- apply(microarray_data, 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Visualize missing values
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(gene = rownames(microarray_data), missing_count = missing_counts), aes(x = gene, y = missing_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Missing Values per Gene", x = "Genes", y = "Missing Values")
```

Identify genes with specific missing values

```{r}
# Set percentage thresholds
threshold_10 <- 0.1 * ncol(microarray_data)
threshold_20 <- 0.2 * ncol(microarray_data)
threshold_50 <- 0.5 * ncol(microarray_data)

# Filter genes with more than X% missing values
genes_10_percent <- which(missing_counts > threshold_10)
genes_20_percent <- which(missing_counts > threshold_20)
genes_50_percent <- which(missing_counts > threshold_50)

# Display the genes
genes_10_percent
genes_20_percent
genes_50_percent

# Replacing missing values with the avarage expression for each gene
# Replace missing values with the mean per gene
microarray_data_imputed <- microarray_data  # Create a copy
microarray_data_imputed[] <- apply(microarray_data_imputed, 1, function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), x))
```

Now `microarray_data_imputed` contains the imputed data

  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))
  )
```

The CO2 uptake of the plants in Quebec is higher then in Mississippi. In
both locations plants that are not treated (nonchilled) have a higher
CO2 uptake. With increasing CO2 concentration the CO2 uptake increases
as well.
